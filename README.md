# Statistics and Data Analysis Portfolio – Komi Ayi  
**Statistician | Data Analyst | Research & Innovation**

Welcome to my professional portfolio.

I am a statistician with a strong academic background in mathematics and a specialization in applied statistics.  
I hold a Master’s degree focused on causal modeling and its applications in health research.

This portfolio presents a curated selection of my academic, research, and personal projects involving data analysis, statistical modeling, and causal inference.  
It also includes an overview of my technical skills, certifications, and key achievements.

My work reflects a commitment to rigorous methodology, innovation, and the practical use of data to support decision-making-particularly in public health and research contexts.

Feel free to explore the repository and contact me for collaboration or opportunities.
