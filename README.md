In this project I have used survival analysis to study how the likelihood of the customer churn changes over time. I have also implementd a Random Forest model to predict the customer churn and deployed a model using flask webapp on Heroku. [App](https://churn-prediction-app.herokuapp.com/).

## Micro Projects
- ### R Packages
    - [Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/archd3sai/Statistical-Methods/blob/master/genetic-algorithm.ipynb) : In this file, I have implemented simple genetic algorithm that finds out the list of numbers which equal to any specified number when summed together.
    - [Linear Regression](https://github.com/archd3sai/Statistical-Methods/blob/master/Linear%20Regression.ipynb): In this file, I aim to solve linear regression using analytical method and also by implementing gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent and minibatch gradient descent algorithms.

- ### Challenges
    - [SQL Challenges](https://github.com/archd3sai/SQL): This repository contains codes of online SQL challenges (From Hackerrank, Leetcode, Testdome, etc.) solved by me.
    - [Data Science Challenges](https://github.com/archd3sai/DS-Challenges): This repository contains codes of online Data Science challenges (From Hackerrank, TestDome, etc.) solved by me.
    
- ### Ranking Algorithms
    - [Ranking of NFL teams using Markov-chain methods](https://github.com/archd3sai/Ranking-of-NFL-Teams-using-Markov-method/blob/master/Ranking%20of%20NFL%20teams%20Report.pdf) : In this project I implemented and compared three stationary distribution of Markov-chain based approaches to rank 32 NFL (National Football League) teams from "Best" to "Worst" using the scores of 2007 NFL regular season.
    - [Ranking of Tennis players](https://github.com/archd3sai/Tennis-Players-Ranking/blob/master/TennisRanking.ipynb) : Objective of this project is to rank all Tennis Players based on the matches they played in the year of 2018. This project comprises 4 approaches to rank Tennis players and I have tried to make these approaches more robust sequentially.
